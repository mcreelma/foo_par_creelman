# Foo Parameterization Package

Welcome to the documentation for the `foo_param` package, which provides a neat and tidy package to include calculations of the Foo et al. parameterization.

## Overview

The `foo_param` package is designed to compute the volume of a sphere given its radius using the methodology outlined by Foo et al. (2017). This package is intended to be a community project with the expectation of continuous development and contributions from various users over the years.

## Key Features

- **Simple API**: Easily calculate the volume of a sphere with a single function call.
- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid input, such as negative radius values.
- **Community-Driven**: Designed to be extended and improved by a wide range of contributors.

## Installation

To install the `foo_param` package, navigate to the directory containing `setup.py` and run:

```sh
pip install .
```

This will install the package and its dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Usage


# Usage 
Here is a quick example of how to use the foo_param package for a python script:

```sh
from foo_param.core import calculate_volume

# Define the radius of the sphere
radius = 5

# Calculate the volume
volume = calculate_volume(radius)

# Print the result
print(f"The volume of the sphere with radius {radius} is {volume:.2f}")

```
