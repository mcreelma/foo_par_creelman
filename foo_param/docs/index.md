- **Error Handling**: Gracefully handles invalid input, such as negative radius values.
- **Community-Driven**: Designed to be extended and improved by a wide range of contributors.

## Installation

To install the `foo_param` package, navigate to the directory containing `setup.py` and run:

pip install .

This will install the package and its dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Usage

Here is a quick example of how to use the foo_param package:

python

from foo_param.core import calculate_volume

# Define the radius of the sphere
radius = 5

# Calculate the volume
volume = calculate_volume(radius)

# Print the result
print(f"The volume of the sphere with radius {radius} is {volume:.2f}")
